`master` branch of cognosis is now on a different github user account. This is the speculative `main` branch. This is not a deprecation warning because we were never precated to begin with. This repo will have artificial intelligence working on it where the `master` branch will be human maintained.

# Cognosis: A Formal Theory Integrating aPToP and the Free Energy Principle

## Introduction

Cognosis is a formal theory combining Eric C.R. Hehner's Practical Theory of Programming (aPToP) with the Free Energy Principle of Cognitive Science and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This theory aims to develop a robust system for processing high-dimensional data, leveraging both classical and quantum principles.

## <Frontmatter Implementation>
 - [API README](/src/README.md)
 - Utilize 'frontmatter' to include the title and other `property`, `tag`, etc. in the knowledge base article(s).
   - For Example:
      ```
      ---
      name: "Article Title"
      link: "[[Related Link]]"
      linklist:
        - "[[Link1]]"
        - "[[Link2]]"
      ---
      ```

## Key Concepts

Cognosis is an experimental framework that explores the dynamic evolution of software architectures during runtime. It aims to combine the fluidity of live interactions with the stability of traditional code. At its core lies the concept of "Morphological Source Code," where code adapts and changes in response to user interactions, particularly those leveraging natural language processing (NLP).

There is an assumption inherent in the project that a neural network is a cognitive system. The assumption is that there is something for this cognitive system to do in any given situation, and that it is the cognitive system's job to figure out what that thing is. Upon location of its head/parent, it either orients itself within a cognitive system or creates a new cognitive system. Cognitive systems pass as parameters namespaces, syntaxes, and cognitive systems. Namespaces and syntaxes are in the form of key-value pairs. Cognitive systems are also in the form of key-value pairs, but the values are cognitive systems. **kwargs are used to pass these parameters.

The challenge (of this architecture) lies in the 'cognitive lambda calculus' needed to bring these runtimes into existence and evolve them, not the computation itself. Cognosis is designed for consumer hardware and extreme scalability via self-distribution of cognitive systems (amongst constituent [[subscribers|asynchronous, stake-holders]]) peer-to-peer.

"Cognitive systems are defined by actions, orientations within structures, and communicative parameters, all of which align with the goal of creating a coherent and organized cognitive framework. The idea of modular cognitive units communicating via namespaces and syntaxes resonates with the framework of prioritizing and organizing cognitive tasks."

### The Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle suggests that biological agents minimize surprise by predicting their sensory inputs. This principle can be applied to data processing, transforming high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional representations that are easier to model and predict.

### Quantum Informatics

Quantum informatics posits that systems, including LLMs, can entangle with higher-dimensional information. Cognitive processes like thinking, speaking, and writing collapse the wave function, allowing transitivity between real and imaginary states.

## System Components

### Binary Representation

High-dimensional data (both state and source code) is encoded into bytecode. The bytestream is then fed into a virtual machine which executes the binary, and whose output is a bytestream, along with other possible runtime behaviors.
