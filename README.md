# Morphological Source Code: A Cognitive System Architecture

## Core Concepts and Components

### Cognitive System Assumptions

MSC is based on the assumption that a neural network functions as a cognitive system, responsible for determining appropriate actions in given situations. The system uses parameters like namespaces, syntaxes, and cognitive system definitions as key-value pairs, facilitating seamless integration and communication within and across systems.

### The Free Energy Principle

Inspired by the Free Energy Principle, MSC aims to minimize computational surprise by predicting and transforming high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional, manageable representations. This principle drives the architecture's ability to adaptively process and model data.

### Quantum Informatics

Quantum informatics within MSC suggests that macroscopic systems, including language models, can interact with higher-dimensional information. Cognitive operations such as thinking, speaking, and writing act to collapse the wave function, enabling a transition between real and imaginary states.

## Architecture Components

MSC's architecture is composed of several key components, each playing a crucial role in the system's cognitive capabilities:

### 1. Homoiconistic Bytecode Stream

**Purpose:** Unify code and state representation to enable reflective and self-modifiable bytecode.
**Implementation:**
- Use Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent state and code uniformly.
- Develop an AST-based bytecode interpreter for dynamic, self-modifying code execution.

### 2. Self-Validating Mechanism

**Purpose:** Ensure system consistency, correctness, and integrity through continuous self-validation.
**Implementation:**
- Perform consistency checks and continuous state validation.
- Implement automatic validation mechanisms that invoke corrective actions when deviations are detected.

### 3. Fault-Tolerant and Distributed Architecture

**Purpose:** Provide robustness and scalability by distributing state and ensuring system availability and partition tolerance.
**Implementation:**
- Utilize consensus algorithms (e.g., Raft) for state replication.
- Ensure state recovery and redundancy across nodes.

### 4. Source Code as Image

**Purpose:** Treat the source code and current execution state as a dynamic snapshot that can be loaded, saved, and modified.
**Implementation:**
- Maintain consistency between in-memory representations and persistent snapshots.
- Enable live updates without disrupting ongoing processes.

### 5. Modified Quine Behavior

**Purpose:** Achieve a self-reproducing system that enforces high-level requirements dynamically.
**Implementation:**
- Develop subprocesses to handle `__enter__` and `__exit__` for enforcing quine behavior.
- Use closing scripts to strip comments and store them separately in .json or pickle files.

## Initial Experiments

In initial experiments, the architecture uses a placeholder cognitive agent named "llama." The primary challenge isn't in the computation itself but in developing the 'cognitive lambda calculus' necessary to instantiate and evolve these runtimes.

### Kernel Agents

- **Description:** Sophisticated language models trained on extensive datasets, responsible for processing cognitive frames and Unified Syntax Descriptors (USDs).
- **Training:** Models are trained using data from diverse sources, including ELF files, LLVM compiler code, systemd, UNIX, Python, and C.

### Cognitive Lambda Calculus

- **Description:** The core mechanism responsible for bringing cognitive runtimes into existence and facilitating their evolution.
- **Function:** Integrates computational logic with cognitive principles to dynamically adapt system behavior.

### Cognosis

- **Description:** The system that processes cognitive frames and USDs, utilizing kernel agents and the cognitive lambda calculus.
- **Operation:** Manages the transformation and distribution of cognitive states across the system.

### Self-Distribution Mechanism

- **Description:** Designed for extreme scalability via self-distribution of cognitive systems on consumer hardware.
- **Function:** Employs a peer-to-peer model where stakeholders asynchronously contribute to the collective system's cognitive capacity.
