## 5. Events

### Event Format

[[Events]] are objects with required fields:

- `id`: Unique ID of the event
- `type`: The type of event, such as a message or a reaction
- `detail_type`: Optional subtype or detail defining the event context (e.g., private, group, or channel)
- `message`: The content of the event (e.g., text, image, file)
- `time`: The timestamp of the event

Additional optional fields:

* `source`: The origin of the event, such as a user, group, or channel
* `target`: The intended recipient or target of the event
* `content`: The main content, including text, image, or file associated with the event
* `metadata`: Additional metadata to provide more context about the event, such as file size, image resolution, etc.

```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "type": "message",
  "detail_type": "private",
  "message": [
    {"type": "text", "data": {
      "text": "Hello world"
    }}
  ]
}
```

## 6. Actions

### 6.1 Actions Overview

[[Action requests]] are sent by the application to request services. [[Responses]] are returned by [[AtomicBot]] after processing the requests.

### 6.2 Sending a Message Example

Action Request Example:

```json
{
  "action": "send_message",
  "params": {
    "message": ["Hi there!"]
  },
  "self": {
    "platform": "telegram",
    "user_id": "123"
  }
}
```

Action Response Example:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "retcode": 0,
  "data": {
    "result": "success"
  },
  "echo": "123"
}
```

## 7. HTTP Communication

### 7.1 Configuration

[[AtomicBot]] runs an HTTP server based on configuration:

- `host`: Listening IP
- `port`: Listening port
- `access_token`: Authentication token
- `event_enabled`: Enable event polling
- `event_buffer_size`: Event buffer size
- `ssl_cert_path`: Path to the SSL certificate file for HTTPS connections
- `ssl_key_path`: Path to the SSL private key file for HTTPS connections


[[AtomicBot]] handles requests at `/` and returns action responses.

### 7.2 Authentication

If `access_token` is set, [[AtomicBot]] authenticates via:

- Authorization header
- access_token query parameter

### 7.3 Content Types

Supported request content types:

- `application/json` (MUST be supported)
- `application/msgpack` (MAY be supported)

Response Content-Type mirrors request.

### 7.4 Event Polling

If `event_enabled` is true, [[AtomicBot]] supports `get_latest_events` to poll events. It provides an event buffer of configurable `event_buffer_size`.

## 7.5 Webhook

[[AtomicBot]] supports webhooks for pushing events to an external endpoint. Configuration for the webhook includes:

- `url`: The destination URL where events will be posted.
- `access_token`: Optional authentication token.
- `timeout`: The maximum duration before a webhook request times out.

#### 7.5.1 Webhook Headers

Required request headers:

- `Content-Type`: application/json
- `User-Agent`: AtomicBot version
- `X-AtomicBot-Version`: AtomicBot version
- `X-Impl`: AtomicBot implementation

Optional `Authorization` header for authentication.

#### 7.5.2 Webhook Authentication

[[AtomicBot]] allows multiple ways to authenticate webhook requests:

1. **Authorization Header**: Include the token in the `Authorization` HTTP header.
   
   Example: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`

2. **Query Parameter**: Alternatively, the `access_token` can be sent as a query parameter in the URL: `GET /webhook?access_token=<access_token>`

#### 7.5.3 Webhook Timeout

Request timeout is based on the configured timeout value.

## 8. WebSocket Communication

[[AtomicBot]] supports [[WebSocket]] server and client roles. It forwards events to clients and handles action requests.

### 8.1 Authentication

If `access_token` is set, [[AtomicBot]] authenticates before handshake via: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header. Authentication is done by:

- Sending an `Authorization` header during the WebSocket handshake request:
- Alternatively, passing the `access_token` as a query parameter in the WebSocket URL: `ws://<host>:<port>?access_token=<access_token>`

### 8.2 Events and Actions

- Events as JSON
- Action requests as JSON or MessagePack
- Responses use the request format

### 8.3 WebSocket Forward

[[AtomicBot]] runs a WebSocket server based on configuration:

- `host`: Listening IP
- `port`: Listening port
- `access_token`: Authentication

It accepts connections at `/` and handles events and actions.

### 8.4 WebSocket Reverse

[[AtomicBot]] connects to a WebSocket endpoint based on configuration:

- `url`: WebSocket URL
- `access_token`: Authentication
- `reconnect_interval`: Reconnect interval

It handles events and actions after connecting.

## 9. Data Types

### 9.1 Type Values


[[AtomicBot]] uses a variety of data types in requests and responses, with the following supported:

- `Integer`: int64, uint64, int32, uint32, int16, uint16, int8, uint8
- `Float`: float64
- `String`: string
- `Bytes`: Base64-encoded string or byte array
- `Array`: any[]
- `Map`: map[key_type]value_type
- `Object`: object (map[string]any)
- `Timestamp`: A string or integer that represents a specific point in time, usually in ISO 8601 or Unix epoch format, to better handle time-sensitive data
- `Boolean`: True or False
- `Null`: nil, not a number, or undefined

### 9.2 Action Response

[[Action responses]] are objects with required fields:

- `resp`: Action name
- `status`: Status
- `retcode`: Return code
- `data`: Response data
- `message`: Error message

### 9.3 Event Format

[[Events]] are objects with required fields:

- `id`: Unique ID
- `self`: Sender identity
- `time`: Timestamp
- `type`: Event type

### 9.4 Action Request Format

[[Action requests]] are objects with required fields:

- `action`: Action name
- `params`: Parameters

Optional fields:

- `echo`: Identifier
- `self`: Sender identity

### 9.5 Action Response Format

[[Action responses]] are objects with required fields

:

- `status`: ok or failed
- `retcode`: Return code
- `data`: Response data
- `message`: Error message

Optional fields:

- `echo`: Mirrors request identifier

## 10. Return Codes

Return codes are used to indicate the result of action requests and event processing. [[AtomicBot]] categorizes errors into three major types:

- `0`: Successful execution.
- `1xxxx`: Client-side request errors.
- `2xxxx`: Server-side handler errors.
- `3xxxx`: Execution errors (e.g., timeout, memory limit).

### 10.1 Request Errors

These errors indicate issues with the request, similar to HTTP 4xx client errors:

| Code   | Error                | Cause                       |
| ------ | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 10001  | Bad Request           | Malformed request format     |
| 10002  | Unsupported Action    | Action is not implemented    |
| 10003  | Bad Parameter         | Invalid parameters provided  |

### 10.2 Handler Errors

Errors that occur during the processing of a request, akin to HTTP 5xx server errors:

| Code   | Error                | Cause                        |
| ------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 20001  | Bad Handler           | Issue with the handler logic |
| 20002  | Internal Handler Error | Unhandled exception in code  |

### 10.2 Handler Errors

Similar to HTTP 5xx server errors.

| Code   | Error                  | Cause                             |
| ------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 20001  | Bad Handler            | Implementation error              |
| 20002  | Internal Handler Error | Uncaught exception                |
| 20003  | Timeout                | Request took too long to process  |
| 20004  | Memory Exhaustion      | Handler exceeded memory limits    |


## 11. Robot Self Identification

TODO: Add detailed description of robot self-identification fields and format.

## 12. Security Considerations

### 12.1 Heuristics
- Ensure secure transmission (e.g., TLS/SSL) for HTTP and WebSocket communication.
- Use strong authentication mechanisms to protect against unauthorized access.
- Validate and sanitize all input data to prevent injection attacks.

These practices are necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of [[AtomicBot]], especially in production environments.

"Production" refers to, at a minimum, any networking beyond the local dev-env. To secure the interaction between clients and [[AtomicBot]], the following security measures must be in place for networked environments:

- Encryption: Ensure secure transmission using TLS/SSL for both HTTP and WebSocket communication. Self-signed or third-party certificates should be properly configured for production environments.
- Authentication: Use strong authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 or token-based authentication to restrict unauthorized access.
- Input Validation: All input data must be thoroughly validated and sanitized to prevent common injection attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Access Control: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different users and bots to ensure that only authorized entities can trigger certain actions or access sensitive data.
- Rate Limiting - To prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, enforce rate-limiting for both HTTP and WebSocket endpoints.


## 13. Compliance and Conformance

To be compliant with the [[AtomicBot Standard]], implementations MUST adhere to the protocols and data formats specified in this document. Implementations SHOULD provide conformance tests to validate compliance.

## 14. Examples and Use Cases

### 14.1 Sending a Message Example

To send a message, the application sends an [[action request]]:

```json
{
  "action": "send_message",
  "params": {
    "message": ["Hi there!"]
  },
  "self": {
    "platform": "telegram",
    "user_id": "123"
  }
}
```

The [[AtomicBot]] responds:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "retcode": 0,
  "data": {
    "result": "success"
  },
  "echo": "123"
}
```

### 14.2 Receiving an Event Example

An example [[event]] received from [[AtomicBot]]:

```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "time": 1632847927,
  "type": "message",
  "detail_type": "private",
  "sub_type": "",
  "self": {
    "platform": "telegram",
    "user_id": "123"  
  },
  "message": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "data": {
        "text": "Hello world"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 15. Markdown Encoding and Double-Bracketed Entities

```markdown
#Markdown Encoding and Linkage

This specification is designed to be readable in plain text and common markdown renderers, leveraging both double-bracketed entities and angle-bracketed chunks for enhanced interactivity and modularity.
Double-Bracketed Entities

To facilitate knowledge graphing and associative linking of concepts, significant entities are enclosed in double brackets like this: [[Entity Name]]. When rendered in environments that support it (such as Obsidian), the double-bracketed terms become clickable links that can display contextual information and connections to related concepts. These entities are associated with the ~/kb/* knowledge base directory.

For example:

    [[API]] could link to documentation on what an API is.
    [[Chatbot]] may link to background on chatbots.
    [[JSON Data Interchange Format]] could expand into details on the JSON specification.

This makes the document itself an interactive knowledge repository in supported environments, while still being readable as plain markdown elsewhere. The double-bracket syntax was chosen specifically for compatibility with the popular Obsidian.md format. Although not a requirement of the AtomicBot specification, using this markup style can turn documentation into a powerful conceptual knowledge base when authored with tools like Obsidian that support this notation.
Angle-Bracketed Chunks

To organize and modularize the document, this specification leverages the use of angle-bracketed chunks. Chunks are denoted by double angle brackets like this: <<chunk_name>>. This format allows for the inclusion of code or content sections from different parts of the document in a structured and readable way. These chunks are associated with the ~/db/* database section, and the system is designed to search this directory for any angle-bracketed entities and attempt to resolve them to specific file system objects.

When rendered or processed in the [[cognosis]] literate cognitive framing environment (CLI and runtime), the double angle-bracketed chunks act as placeholders for code or content blocks defined elsewhere in the document. Additionally, these chunks can be used as anchor tags, allowing for micro-navigation to specific subsections in a command line interface style. This enhances the document's usability by enabling quick navigation to key sections directly.

For instance:

    <<initialization>> could link to a file system object in ~/db/* that initializes variables or settings.
    <<function_definitions>> might navigate to a section compiling all function definitions together.
    <<cleanup>> could ensure resources are properly released at the end of a script.

This chunking approach makes it easier to navigate and understand the document's structure, especially in larger specifications or literate programs. The double angle-bracket syntax was chosen for its clarity and compatibility with many literate programming conventions, fitting seamlessly with tools that support this notation. While not a requirement of the AtomicBot specification, using this markup style can transform documentation into a modular and easily navigable structure, especially when used with tools that support angle-bracketed chunks and command line navigation.
```
