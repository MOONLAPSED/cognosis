## Frontmatter Implementation

 - Utilize 'frontmatter' to include the title and other `property`, `tag`, etc. in the knowledge base article(s).
   
   - For Example:
      ```
      ---
      name: "Article Title"
      link: "[[Related Link]]"
      linklist:
        - "[[Link1]]"
        - "[[Link2]]"
      ---
      ``` """
