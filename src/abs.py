class BaseContextManager(ABC):
    """
    Defines the interface for a context manager, ensuring a resource is properly
    managed, with setup before entering the context and cleanup after exiting.

    This abstract base class must be subclassed to implement the `__enter__` and
    `__exit__` methods, enabling use with the `with` statement for resource
    management, such as opening and closing files, acquiring and releasing locks,
    or establishing and terminating network connections.

    Implementers should override the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods according to
    the resource's specific setup and cleanup procedures.

    Methods
    -------
    __enter__()
        Called when entering the runtime context, and should return the resource
        that needs to be managed.

    __exit__(exc_type, exc_value, traceback)
        Called when exiting the runtime context, handles exception information if any,
        and performs the necessary cleanup.

    See Also
    --------
    with statement : The `with` statement used for resource management in Python.

    Notes
    -----
    It's important that implementations of `__exit__` method should return `False` to
    propagate exceptions, unless the context manager is designed to suppress them. In
    such cases, it should return `True`.

    Examples
    --------

    Serves as an abstract foundational structure for defining interfaces

    to be implemented for encoding/decoding data and handling data transmission
    over an established communication channel.

    It is expected that concrete implementations will provide the necessary
    business logic for the actual encoding schemes, data transmission methods,
    and connection management appropriate to the chosen communication medium.

    Methods
    ----------
    encode(data)
        Converts data into a format suitable for transmission.

    decode(encoded_data)
        Converts data from the transmission format back to its original form.

    transmit(encoded_data)
        Initiates transfer of encoded data over the communication protocol's channel.

    send(data)
        Packets and sends data ensuring compliance with the underlying transmission protocol.

    receive()
        Listens for incoming data, decodes it, and returns the original message.

    connect()
        Initiates the communication channel, making it active and ready to use.

    disconnect()
        Properly closes and cleans up the established communication channel.
