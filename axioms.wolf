canonicalRepresentation == `∀x, y ∈ S, x * y ∈ S`
**Axiom of Closure**
In WolframScript, the axiom of closure can be represented as:
    `[ForAll]x, y [Element] S, x * y [Element] S`
    This expression states that for all elements `x` and `y` in set `S`, the result of their multiplication `x * y` is also an element of `S`.

**Equivalence Principle**
To represent the equivalence principle, we can use the following expression:
    `[ForAll]x, y [Element] S, x ≡ y ⇒ x * z ≡ y * z`
    This expression states that for all elements `x` and `y` in set `S`, if `x` is equivalent to `y`, then `x` multiplied by `z` is equivalent to `y` multiplied by `z`.

**Self-Consistency**
Self-consistency can be represented as:
    `[ForAll]x [Element] S, x * x ≡ x`
    This expression states that for all elements `x` in set `S`, `x` multiplied by itself is equivalent to `x`.

**Non-Linear Deformation (Symmetry, Relativity, Locality)**
To represent non-linear deformation, we can use the following expression:
    `[ForAll]x, y [Element] S, f(x * y) ≡ f(x) * f(y)`
    This expression states that for all elements `x` and `y` in set `S`, the function `f` applied to the product `x * y` is equivalent to the product of `f` applied to `x` and `f` applied to `y`.

**Simulation of Quantum Entanglement in Flat Spacetime**
To represent the simulation of quantum entanglement in flat spacetime, we can use the following expression:
    `[ForAll]x, y [Element] S, E(x, y) ≡ E(y, x)`
    This expression states that for all elements `x` and `y` in set `S`, the entanglement relation `E` between `x` and `y` is equivalent to the entanglement relation between `y` and `x`.

**Exclusion Principle**
To represent the exclusion principle, we can use the following expression:
    `[ForAll]x, y [Element] S, x ≠ y ⇒ x * y ≡ 0`
    This expression states that for all elements `x` and `y` in set `S`, if `x` is not equal to `y`, then their product `x * y` is equivalent to 0.

**Morphological Source Code**
To represent morphological source code, we can use the following expression:
    `[ForAll]x [Element] S, x ↦ bytecode[x] ↦ runtime[x] ↦ bytecode[x]`
    This expression states that for all elements `x` in set `S`, the morphological source code `x` can be converted to bytecode, executed at runtime, and then converted back to bytecode, capturing any state changes.

**Modified Quine-like Behavior**
To represent modified quine-like behavior, we can use the following expression:
    `[ForAll]x [Element] S, x ↦ bytecode[x] ↦ runtime[x] ↦ bytecode[x'] ⇒ x' ≡ x`
    This expression states that for all elements `x` in set `S`, the morphological source code `x` can be converted to bytecode, executed at runtime, and then converted back to bytecode, capturing any state changes, and the resulting bytecode `x'` is equivalent to the original `x`.
