"""chatGPT(v0.3)
In this implementation, I have defined a FormalTheory class that takes a theory string as input and parses it into three components: the header (BNF grammar), the payload, and the logical switch ("Theory" or "Anti-Theory"). The class provides the following functionality:

Parsing the Theory String: The parse method uses regular expressions to extract the header, payload, and logical switch from the input theory string.
Parsing the BNF Grammar: The parse_bnf method converts the BNF grammar string from the header into a dictionary representation, where the keys are non-terminals, and the values are lists of expressions.
Syntax Validation: The validate_syntax method is a generator function that recursively validates the syntax of a non-terminal by expanding its expressions according to the grammar. It yields the terminal symbols that match the payload.
Logical Validation: The is_valid method checks if the payload matches the syntax defined by the grammar. If the payload is valid according to the grammar, it returns True if the logical switch is "Theory", and False if the logical switch is "Anti-Theory". If the payload is invalid according to the grammar, it returns False regardless of the logical switch.

The implementation includes an example usage where a theory string is defined, and a FormalTheory object is created. The is_valid method is called, and the result is printed, which should be True for the given example.
This implementation demonstrates how the FormalTheory protocol can be realized using Python. It follows the principles of parsing the header (BNF grammar), validating the syntax of the payload against the grammar, and applying the logical switch based on the validity of the payload.
